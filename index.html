        <section id="intro-1" class="template">
            <p>Oh thank the Great Goddess!</p>
            <p>I've spent three years doing nothing but jumping around various dimensions and I finally managed to track you down.</p>
            <p>It's me, your best friend Leron! It's so good to see you! You look a lot different from what I remember. What happened to you?</p>
            <p>Oh right, of course... You can't remember me since that damned Necromancer sealed your memories away when she sent you here. Don't worry though, I'll help you get back to where you belong, we could really use your help back there. Your mom was devasted when you disappeared you know? I haven't heard from her since, I hope she's doing alright.</p>
            <p>Things aren't going so well back there. The Necromancer has spent these three years you were away harassing people. The first thing that happened was the Queen becoming paranoid and sealing off the castle, without their ruler the country doesn't know what to do. Princess Jule wasn't in the castle on Day Zero though, the same day we lost you by the way, and she's been doing all she can to maintain order. She's been trying to introduce a sort of democracy so people feel safe once more.</p>
            <p>We played with her sometimes when we were kids. If I remember correctly, she bossed us around a lot. She's gotten a lot kinder over the years and I'm certain she'll be happy to see you again.</p>
            <p>Now, I <em>might</em> be able to give back all your memories at once, but it could overload your brain and kill you. I won't risk that. I'll help you choose what to do, who to bring and all that jazz but I'll only give you enough information for you to decide. I won't try to sway you. You'll get all your memories back once we defeat the Necromancer, I'm sure of it.</p>
            <p>Let's get back home now, okay?</p>
        </section>
        <section id="intro-2" class="template">
            <p>Welcome back to Genr. This isn't how things usually look, I swear.</p>
            <p>Well considering we've been without a Queen for three years and the Army has more or less been disbanded, things are pretty good. We're in Parlor right now, the city we grew up in. Your mom moved away after you vanished. Can't say I blame her. Things are still nice here, kids play, laugh and banter, oblivious to everything going on.</p>
            <p>There are other places, like Fwib, that weren't so lucky. I was there on Day One, when the Necromancer's army rolled in. It was bad. Too many died or surrendered. She's set up fort there since</p>
            <p>That's the most dangerous area in Genr at the moment. Allegedly she's released most of the people who surrendered, and they all claim the others are free to leave but choose to stay. I wouldn't trust them, she could've easily brainwashed them. But it does make me wonder what's going on...</p>

            <h2>Your Memories</h2>
            <p>Well, the first thing you should do is try to remember how you were like before the Necromancer tampered with your mind.</p>
            <p>Your memories will determine how much Power of <strong class="friendship">Friendship</strong> and Strength of <em class="character">Character</em> you have</p>

                    <p>I loved having classes with you. We didn't learn much, but who cares! We had fun, right? Even the teacher didn't seem to mind that much, she never scolded you too badly when you misbehaved. Maybe you should have paid a bit more attention though, you could've been so much smarter and stronger if you had. You wouldn't have as many friends though.</p>

                    <p>By the Goddess, you kicked everyone's asses in combat training. You were no fun to fight with. I do think we managed to hold you down once, when all our classmates jumped you at once. Yeah, it was dirty, but try losing all your fights while the your opponent isn't even paying attention. You did teach me a few tricks though, and I appreciate it.</p>

I get that she was teasing, but still that's hella rude to say to your brother. No one in town hated or even dislike you, but then again why would they? You were... you <em>are</em>, a great person. You never picked a fight with anyone, but you sure have ended a few.</p>

I'll be honest with you, it made me jealous to see you so well-liked by everyone. But you've never forgotten your old friends, and I sure haven't forgotten you. I'm so happy you're coming back!</p>

But it seemed like you never had time for anything but training, I don't even remember how we became friends. I always felt like I was holding you back, or boring you. I volunteered to get you back to repay you for all the days you spent with me, and not training like you wanted to.</p>

                        <p>Yeah, I know the term is rather vague, but you won't recognize the proper word. Anyway, supportive magic covers a wide variety of spells, but mostly affecting people. Everything from healing wounds and curing diseases to cheering someone up or instantly cleaning up a mess.

                        <p>This can most easily be explained as altering mass and density. You can turn a large boulder into a small, super-dense ball and carry it around if you want to. You can shape it into anything, so it's very useful if you're ever caught without a weapon as you can make one from the ground.

I tried using it but it didn't increase the potency of my spells and they were all equally draining. Like any catalyst, it makes spell casting faster and more efficient, but your ring looks a lot more inconspicuous than a large staff. It is very easy to play it off as an accessory.</p>

                    <p>As stubborn and loyal as she is she's also terribly impulsive. When she found out who was responsible for your disappearance she immediately set out to Fwib and joined the assault against the city. I never knew she cared this much about you. Most of her interations with you involved trying to start a fist-fight, which she'd easily win, then spend the rest of the day following you around gloating. I don't mean to make it sound like she tried to fight everyone, It was just you. She's a sweet girl, but so competitive around you. Like she needed to beat you for some reason...</p>

                    <p>She took alchemy and smithing classes a bit too seriously if you ask me. But then again, she's made a special kind of armor that can make your punches far harder and your body move faster than should be possible, quite the achievement for someone so young.
                    <br>
                    Oh and she's not done, there's always something she wants to improve or add to her machines. Last I checked the gauntlets she fought with were at model 26. She definitely sees opportunities rather than limitations when trying to solve a problem, she's not the kind of girl that quits when faced with an impossible task. She'll figure out a way to beat anything.

Sometimes people abuse of her good nature, but thankfully you were always around to punish those who sought to exploit her kindness. She got ridiculous amounts of plants. Heck, she even lives in a massive tree she grew herself. She had to moved out young, her parents didn't appreciate the smell of manure. Luckily nowadays she controls  her flowers to make her smell pleasant.</p>

                    <p>As you'd expect from a kitsune, Kumin has always been a bit of a trickster. She's way too cute for anyone to stay mad at her for long, though her tricks can be seriously extensive and cruel sometimes. She once made a guy think he'd get a girlfriend, but he never got one. She felt bad about it later and has become far more introspective since then. That said, if you need a master tactician or illusionist she's your girl. And if you scratch her behind the ear that's all the thanks she needs, just be sure to stop if her tail isn't wagging. Oh and never call her a catgirl. Really.</p>

Fighting them is annoying, Lyre spams magic while Heinrich keeps you busy in close quarters. They're definitely a force to be reckoned with and I feel sorry for whoever has to fight them seriously. Heinrich is very calm, and in combat he seems to know exactly what you'll do ten seconds before it happens. Lyre is the opposite, despite being a mage he's loud and loves to boast as he spams spells carelessly. They complement each other nicely. We used to joke that they're a lovely couple.</p>

Despite the absence of our queen we're doing just fine thanks to Jule's hark work. She's a brilliant diplomat, likely thanks to the personal tutorage she's had. She hasn't had much of a chance to be a kid, so she loved to visit us whenever she was able to. She likes to hide the fact that she's a princess since people tend to treat her like a damsel in distress after knowing it. I can definitely tell you she's more than capable of protecting herself. Really, there's no reason for her to have a bodyguard.</p>

When sparring with you she never went all out and always had bandages ready to treat any wound she might've caused. She put grat emphasis on studying hard, and usually was willing to help if there was anything we didn't understand. To be honest she was more of a sister than my own was, at least she never meant any of the few insults she said, and she made sure there were no hard feelings after a fight. She'll make an amazing mother and wife one day.</p>

He loves raising skeletons to do his chores, even if it freaked out everyone living in our city. He gets a thrill out of spooking people, and he does know an scary amount of spooky stories. He's great to have on a fieldtrip, if you can convince him not to put a skull next to your pillow. He does play fair and won't be mad if you spook him, if anything he'll take that as a challenge.</p>

Weirdly, since she's the one who specialies in light magic, she's all about keeping everyone healthy and safe. If you want to make her even happier just ask her about her dresses, she loves talking about them. But once she gets going she won't stop. She'll pout until you let her finish talking, and she's fantastic at making you feel guilty if you won't let her. She went searching for your mom after you dissappeared, but had no luck locating her. She said it was like your mom couldn't be found with magic.</p>

If her family ever needed money she'd go out for a week and come back with bags of gold she could barely carry. I don't even know how there can be so much gold so close to us. She surely can't be making it with alchemy, not only that's a crime but she couldn't figure out even the basics of alchemy. She's far too impulsive to sit and study for long.</p>

As a duchess she is treated almost as highly as a princess but with less restrictions placed upon her. So when she's caught doing something reprehensible like charming people into doing things they normally wouldn't it's not as scandalous. She has no ill intent, but she loves playing the matchmaker. She doesn't really consider that other people may not agree with her idea of a "<em>perfect match</em>". There was this one time that... actually I'll spare you the details.</p>

Seriously, I caught her checking people out so many times, and she had no shame at all. What kind of girl doesn't blush when she's caught like that?

Eventually she came to our town and was recruited by Knights when they heard her story. They became her new family, and are the only ones who know her past. Well, except by you, but you never told me about it. I'm sure it must have been rough, it's what made her so strong physically and mentally. Nothing can be too terrifying once you've had to kill Giants after being starved and sleep depraved for days.</p>

                        <p>Lucy came across a page mentioning something called a "<em>Philosopher's Stone</em>" in a diary she found while treasure hunting. The diary claims this stone holds immense power, and can improve someone's magic and alchemy skills immensely. With it we should be on par with the Necromancer for sure. Unfortunately the directions are written in a code. We're working on deciphering it but progress is slow. The diary mentions different places and people, so there are enough clues to follow, but it would take a while to check them all out.</p>

                        <p>The safest route to Fwib goes through a small village near the mountains. Unfortunately, that's where one of the Necromancer's Lieutenent has decided to stay. He's a big and strong monster who harasses the citizens and won't allow anyone to leave. They're starving as he taxes them unreasonably high. What little army remained hasn't able to deal with him. It'll take a bigger force than they can afford at the moment, as their forces are spread out thin to deal with monster threats. With a good strategy a careful planning we should be able to take out the Lieutenent and his men. I hear he's quite prideful, so we may be able to use that in our favor.</p>

                        <p>When old man Marcus retired to a remote island, the queen soon realized how great an asset he truly was. The war she'd started with our neighbouring country a few years earlier suddenly wasn't going so smoothly anymore. We still won, but suffered substantial losses and the queen pulled our forces back after taking their capital. We know the location of Marcus, but getting there won't be easy. There's a desert between us and him, followed by an ocean. I doubt he has any clue what's going on back home. As far as I know he's all alone on that island. If we could recruit him, we'd have a great advantage on the battlefield.</p>

                        <p>There are a lot of humanoid races that generally like to avoid us humans. Our cultures are simply too different. There are some, like the kitsunes, who are more social and interact with us, but most of them just tolerates us when necessary. Despite the Necromancer's army having those humanoid races, we may be able to talk them into fighting for us. It would help improve relationships between our races, there has to be a lot we can learn from them. We'd need to travel to each major race clan and complete a task that relates to their culture. Like impressing the wolfkin with a great feat of strength and leadership.</p>

                        <p>Okay, so hear me out on this one. I asked myself: "How can we get people to <em>want</em> to fight?", and I think I found the perfect thing any man would risk his life to protect. Cute girls in bikinis. We should host some kind of competition where girls act cute and we rate them to find a winner. After seeing how many cute girls there are I'm sure wecan motivate everyone to fight. How could a girl refuse to join when the stakes are so high? It would be selfish not to. Oh, and if you could talk Elely or Erin into joining the competition, I would never ask you anything again. I could die happy if I saw them in bikinis.</p>

    <p>Obviously we'll need to deal with the Necromancer, but there are some things we may want to do first. You'll need time to ajust to your old self before you jump in to fight her.</p>
    <p>We can do as many of those tasks as you want, but we should always remember our main objective.</p>

                <p>There are so many people scared. I don't blame them. The army is hardly doing their job, the country has no leader and monsters are becoming more aggressive. We need every soul available to fight and get our country back on track. The common folk is a complete untapped resource of soldiers. Yes, there are many old and weak, but anyone can be taught to fight half decently. You and our friends have to know how to teach people to fight. If we teach people and train them they wont't need to sit back and wait to be saved, it will be a lot easier to focus on retaking our country that way. They'll be much safer in the future too.</p>
